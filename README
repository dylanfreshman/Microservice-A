The client is where the data gets requested, you can import your main file into the dunder method.
This allows you to use the client to interact with the server which holds the information. This can
be done by using socket.send() then socket.recv() to receive the message from the server.

All of your variables and information can be imported to the server in order for you to interact with
it. On the server end, you first receive then you send a message back to the client from the server.
socket.recv() then socket.send()

IMPORTANT:
If you are receiving and printing strings, make sure you recv().decode('utf-8').
Entire objects can be sent.

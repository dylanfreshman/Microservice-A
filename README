Microservice README

The client is where the data gets requested, you can import your main file into the dunder method.
This allows you to use the client to interact with the server which holds the information. This can
be done by using socket.send() then socket.recv() to receive the message from the server.

All of your variables and information can be imported to the server in order for you to interact with
it. On the server end, you first receive then you send a message back to the client from the server.
socket.recv() then socket.send()

To interact with the server from the client end, you need to encode a socket.send() a message, allowing the server
to receive that message. Once sent, the server must have a coded socket.recv(), allowing it to receive that message.
Once this is done, you can use if statements, or even print statements, to interpret this information. This can also
be done in the opposite order, where the server sends a message to the client, although the server first needs to receive
a message before sending one. 

IMPORTANT:
If you are receiving and printing strings, make sure you recv().decode('utf-8').
Entire objects can be sent.
